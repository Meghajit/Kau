/*
 * We only save the UUID of sender and receiver. This is to maintain smaller payload of the letter in general.
 * The UI can fetch once and cache a map of UUID -> User. There afterwards, it can show the appropriate UI when showing messages
 *
 * Times is an array which will save the times of various receipts like sent, received and delivered.
 * It's important to note that even though user might have turned off delivery receipts, Kau
 * will still associate and save the Times info for all different types of receipts
 * to a Letter all the time. We do this because we might need it for analytics and security reasons.
 * At the gateway layer, elements of this array will be mutated as per user preferences saved in the
 * User object (User object will be cached in memory after fetching from ETCD) so that user can only see delivery receipts as per his
 * preference.
